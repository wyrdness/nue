      "full": "The Nue is one of Japan's most fearsome yokai, described as a chimeric creature combining parts from multiple animals. Most commonly depicted with a **monkey's head**, **tanuki (raccoon dog) body**, **tiger's limbs**, and a **snake for a tail**. Some versions describe it as having the face of a monkey, body of a tiger, snake tail, and the voice of a white thrush bird. The Nue appears as a black cloud and brings supernatural illness, nightmares, and misfortune. Its most famous appearance was during the Heian period when it caused Emperor Konoe's mysterious illness in the 12th century, until the legendary warrior **Minamoto no Yorimasa** shot it down with an arrow. The creature symbolizes chaos, supernatural pestilence, and ominous portents in Japanese folklore."
