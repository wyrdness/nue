## The Legend of Emperor Konoe

### The Emperor's Affliction (1153) ⭐

> **Date**: 1153
> **Location**: Imperial Palace, Kyoto, Japan
> **Key Figures**: Emperor Konoe, Minamoto no Yorimasa

A black cloud appeared nightly above the Imperial Palace, and Emperor Konoe fell mysteriously ill with terrible nightmares. No physician could cure him, and the court feared for his life.

The legendary warrior **Minamoto no Yorimasa** was summoned to the palace. Armed with his bow, he waited on a dark night for the black cloud to appear. When it materialized above the palace, Yorimasa drew his bow and shot a single arrow into the darkness.

The arrow found its mark. With an unearthly cry, the **Nue** fell from the sky, revealing its terrible chimeric form: the head of a monkey, body of a tanuki, limbs of a tiger, and tail of a snake.

Emperor Konoe's illness immediately ceased. The creature's body was placed in a boat and sent floating down the river, never to plague the court again.

**Historical Context**: This tale from *The Tale of the Heike* exemplifies the role of warriors in protecting the imperial court from supernatural threats and the association of yokai with political instability.
